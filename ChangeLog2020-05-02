The "age" of an individual refers to the infection day, and starts at one, rather than zero. After some thought I decided to leave this as it is. So the user needs to bear in mind that an individual at age 3 means an individual on day 3 of infection. However the following "bug" was fixed in this revision. Depending on where an individual is placed in the sequence (the first free position in the list) their age may update during the iteration in which they were created - this happens if they are placed in the list after their parent. To avoid this occurring, individuals who are placed in the list after their parent are created with age -1. Thus all individual now begin life at age one.
