COVIDAGENT is a free agent based modelling environment for 
modelling the COVID-19 pandemic. The current version is 0.2.

It was formerly named COVIDSIM, but this was changed as several other
modelling environments were found to be using this name. 

It is released under the GNU public license. See the file COPYING for 
details. 

On Linux you can compile with the command 

g++ -lm -std=gnu++11 inf2.cc

You can then run with the command
