Added code to track the number currently infectious - i.e., currently in the infective window (whether or not they are quarantined). 

Added code to track the daily new infections, daily new positive tests, and daily new deaths. 

Added code to properly deal with end of lockdown. Effective infectible population returns to total population at the end of lockdown. Physical distancing returns to pre-lockdown levels. 

Added code to track seroconversion - new parameters "time_to_sero" (default val 10) and "dist_on_sero" (default val 6) control the average time to seroconversion, and the distribution on "time_to_sero" respectively. Each individual has a new property "sero_time" chosen from this distribution. And we track the total seroconversion with the variable "numsero". 

Replaced output of "numill" (which should be ignored) with "numsero". 

Changed the output format for the main output file. Currently: day number, cumulative infections, new infections, current infections, cumulative deaths, new deaths, recorded infections, new recorded infections, currently infectious, seropositive

Some typos and explanation in the code changed.
