TOWNVILLAGE is a toy model with one town and several villages connected to it.
The goal is to illustrate that disease can wind down well even after 
mitigation has ended, and at well below "herd immunity"

For example at the parameter values in TownVillageParams01, lockdown
slows the town epidemic and reduces the coupling between town and villages.
Some village epidemics are triggered before lockdown, and a few during
lockdown, but by the time lockdown finishes, prevalence in the town is low.
The low level town epidemic can still trigger occasional village outbreaks
as it winds down; but many villages do not see an epidemic. 

The code is unnecessarily complicated(!) because it is adapted from a 
more complex model used to model Mumbai's dynamics. 

On Linux you can compile with, say, the command 

g++ -lm -Wall -std=gnu++11 TownVillage.cc -o TownVillage

You can make a directory "output" and run with, say, the command

./TownVillage TownVillageParams01 output/TownVillage01
